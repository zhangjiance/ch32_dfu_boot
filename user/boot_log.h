/*
 * boot_log.h
 *
 * Logging wrapper for the DFU bootloader.  Logging is only compiled in when
 * BOOT_ENABLE_LOG is defined (the Debug configuration sets it); the Release
 * build keeps it out, which also keeps the formatter out of the image.
 *
 * Deliberately header free.  usb_config.h includes this file, so pulling in
 * ch32fun.h here would drag its USBHS registers into the CherryUSB
 * translation units, where they clash with the stack's own definitions.  All
 * it needs is a printf declaration; ch32fun.c provides the implementation and
 * SystemInit() has already brought USART1 up (see user/funconfig.h).
