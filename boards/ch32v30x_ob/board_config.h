/*
 * board_config.h - "ch32v30x_ob"
 *
 * Board Support Package for the CH32V30x onboard target board.
 *
 * Each board lives in its own, self-contained folder under boards/:
 *     boards/<board>/board_config.h   pins / polarity / features (this file)
 *     boards/<board>/board.h          board primitive interface (copy as is)
 *     boards/<board>/board.c          board primitive implementation (copy as is)
 *     boards/<board>/board.cmake      OPTIONAL extra CMake definitions
 *
 * It is the default board of every project that uses it.  Because the whole
 * folder is self-contained, copying it under boards/ of another project and
 * selecting it with -DBOARD=<board> just works.
 *
 * Pins are spelled the way ch32fun addresses them, port * 16 + number
 * (ch32v30xhw.h: PA5, PB10, ...); board.c turns that into the CFGLR/BSHR
 * writes.
 *
 *   BOOT button : PA6 to GND, internal pull-up, active low
 *   status LED  : PA5, active low
 *   app UART    : USART3, PB10 (TX) / PB11 (RX)
